Use the shouldComponentUpdate() method and set it to return true.

When the button is clicked on, the value of the favoriteColor property should change to “pink”.

If you set the return of the shouldComponentUpdate() method to false, you won’t be able to change the value of the favoriteColor property to “blue”, (even after clicking on the button)
