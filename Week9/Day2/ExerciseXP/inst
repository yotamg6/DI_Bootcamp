In the src folder, create a subfolder named components. Add a TransactionForm.js file which will have a state with the properties : accountNumber, FSC, name and amount.
Render a form with four inputs and a submit button.

Use handleInputChange and handleSubmit functions for the form functionality.

Use mapStateToProps to return the state.list(ie. the list of transations) and the state.currentIndex (ie. the current transaction).

Use mapDispatchToProps for the actions.insert and actions.update actions.

Use the connect() function from redux.
